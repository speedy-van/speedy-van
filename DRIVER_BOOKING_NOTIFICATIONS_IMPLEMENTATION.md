# Driver Booking Notifications Implementation

## Overview

This implementation ensures that drivers receive complete booking information after a customer completes their booking, while maintaining customer privacy by excluding email addresses. It also provides smart crew size recommendations based on the pricing engine logic.

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Complete Booking Information (Excluding Customer Email)**

- **Customer Details**: Name and phone number (email intentionally excluded)
- **Addresses**: Full pickup/dropoff with coordinates and property details
- **Schedule**: Date, time slot, estimated duration
- **Items**: Names, quantities, volumes, special requirements
- **Pricing**: Total amount and breakdown
- **Special Requirements**: Any customer-specific notes

### üß† **Smart Crew Size Recommendations**

- **High Confidence**: Items requiring two-person handling
- **Medium Confidence**: High volume jobs, multiple floors with stairs
- **Low Confidence**: Many individual items, fragile items, disassembly needs
- **Factors Considered**: Item properties, property conditions, volume, complexity

## Changes Made

### 1. **Driver Notifications System** (`/lib/driver-notifications.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Creates and manages driver notifications
- **Features**:
  - Sends notifications with complete booking data (excluding email)
  - Generates intelligent crew size recommendations
  - Supports real-time notifications via Pusher (framework ready)
  - Includes notification management functions

### 2. **Driver Job Details Component** (`/components/driver/DriverJobDetails.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive driver dashboard for job information
- **Features**:
  - Complete job overview with all details
  - Smart crew recommendations with confidence levels
  - Visual indicators for item types (fragile, two-person, etc.)
  - Property access information (stairs vs. lift)
  - Action buttons for job management

### 3. **Driver Job API** (`/api/driver/jobs/[id]/route.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Secure API endpoint for drivers to fetch job details
- **Features**:
  - Authentication and authorization checks
  - Complete job data with crew recommendations
  - Job status updates (accept, start, complete)
  - Audit logging for all actions

### 4. **Enhanced Webhook Handler** (`/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)

- **Updates**:
  - Sends driver notifications when payment is completed
  - Includes driver assignment information
  - Maintains admin notification functionality

## Crew Size Recommendation Logic

### **High Confidence Factors (Immediate TWO recommendation)**

- Items marked as `requiresTwoPerson: true`
- Examples: Large sofas, dining tables, heavy appliances

### **Medium Confidence Factors (TWO recommendation)**

- Total volume > 20 cubic meters
- Multiple floors with stairs (no lift access)
- Complex property access conditions

### **Low Confidence Factors (Consider TWO)**

- More than 15 individual items
- Presence of fragile items
- Items requiring disassembly
- High item count with volume considerations

### **Recommendation Display**

- **Color-coded badges**: Blue (ONE), Green (TWO), Orange (THREE), Red (FOUR)
- **Confidence indicators**: High (green), Medium (orange), Low (blue)
- **Factor breakdown**: Detailed list of considerations
- **Clear messaging**: "A second helper is recommended" or "Single driver sufficient"

## Data Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ Full name
- ‚úÖ Phone number
- ‚úÖ Special requirements
- ‚ùå **Email address (intentionally excluded)**

### **Access Control**

- Driver authentication required
- Job assignment verification
- Role-based permissions
- Secure API endpoints

## Driver Dashboard Features

- Estimated duration
- Time-sensitive information

### **Items Inventory**

- Complete item list with quantities
- Volume calculations
- Special handling indicators:
  - üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Two-person required
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Fragile items
  - üîß Needs disassembly
  - üìù Special notes

### **Crew Recommendations**

- **Prominent display** with color coding
- **Confidence levels** and reasoning
- **Factor breakdown** for transparency
- **Actionable guidance** for drivers

## Technical Implementation

### **Database Models Used**

- `DriverNotification` - Driver notification storage
- `Booking` - Main booking information
- `BookingAddress` - Address details
- `BookingProperty` - Property specifications
- `BookingItem` - Item inventory
- `Assignment` - Driver job assignments

### **API Endpoints**

- `GET /api/driver/jobs/[id]` - Fetch job details
- `PUT /api/driver/jobs/[id]` - Update job status
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Payment completion webhook

### **Real-time Features**

- Pusher integration ready
- WebSocket support framework
- Mobile push notification support
