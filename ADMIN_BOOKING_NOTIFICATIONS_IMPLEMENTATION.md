## Data Flow

### 1. **Customer Completes Booking**

```
Customer fills form → Booking data collected → API call to /api/bookings/create
```

### 2. **Database Save**

```
Complete booking data saved → Addresses, properties, items created → Booking ID generated
```

### 3. **Payment Processing**

```
Stripe checkout → Payment completed → Webhook triggered → Admin notification sent
```

### 4. **Admin Notification**

```
Notification created in database → Admin dashboard updated → Complete booking details available
```
